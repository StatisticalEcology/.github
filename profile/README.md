# Centre for Statistics in Ecology, the Environment, and Conservation (SEEC) 

This is the GitHub organization for the Centre for Statistics in Ecology, the Environment, and Conservation (SEEC). SEEC is dedicated to pioneering research and statistical analysis in the fields of ecology, environmental science, and conservation.

## The team 

SEEC consists of a Core Team of 28 members. This
includes 11 academics in GOB-funded positions (9 in the Department of
Statistical Sciences and 2 in the Department of Biological Sciences),
two Research Officers, two postdocs, a Research Fellow, 11 Research
Associates and one part-time Communications Officer. A part-time
administrator position is currently vacant. A subset of the SEEC Core
Team forms the SEEC Leadership Team.

We currently have 18 PhD students and 10 Masters students. Lecturers in Statistical Sciences are often hired
with a Masters degree and then required to do a PhD while also
lecturing. Some of us are therefore Core Team members and PhD students
at the same time. In addition to the Core Team and our postgraduate students, SEEC has
other categories of affiliation, with various degrees of involvement.
